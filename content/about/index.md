The Land of the Crane began life as a campaign setting for Dungeons and Dragons, 3rd edition. It is a world inspired by manga, anime, and a healthy dose of kung-fu films.

As the world grew and matured, it was re-written as a campaign setting for the True20 system and was published by Green Ronin in their True 20: Worlds of Adventure supplement.

Amalara, the company I created to support the True20 version of the world, published several free supplements, which are available below.
