## Traits

**Avoidance.** If the bakeneko is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

**Keen Hearing and Smell.** The bakeneko has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

**Otherworldly Perception.** The bakeneko can sense the presence of any creature within 30 feet of it that is invisible or on the Ethereal Plane. It can pinpoint such a creature that is moving.

**Tail Casting.** The bakeneko can use its tail to provide the somatic component for its spells.

## Actions

**Multiattack.** The bakeneko makes two attacks with its claws.

**Claws.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*  2d6+1 slashing damage.

**Change Shape.** The bakeneko can use its action to polymorph into a humanoid, a house cat, or its true form, which is a small bipedal cat. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The bakeneko’s innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 13, +3 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

- At will: *produce flame*
- 1/day: *animate dead*

## Description

When a house cat reaches the ripe old age of twenty, it develops supernatural powers and becomes a yōkai. It becomes far stronger, gains human intelligence, and grows in size.

Bakeneko make liberal use of their shapeshifting abilities to disguise themselves as normal house cats or even, sometimes, as their master. They often learn to speak human language, and enjoy dancing, singing, and making mischief.

While some bakeneko are content to continue a kept life, others take revenge on unkind masters, killing them off and living in their place. Most households are wary of their cats becoming bakeneko, as many a new yōkai learning to control its powers has accidentally set the family house on fire.

Bakeneko also have the power to animate fresh corpses and use them as puppets.
