## Traits

**Avoidance.** If the nekomata is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

**Keen Hearing and Smell.** The nekomata has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

**Otherworldly Perception.** The nekomata can sense the presence of any creature within 30 feet of it that is invisible or on the Ethereal Plane. It can pinpoint such a creature that is moving.

## Actions

**Multiattack.** The nekomata makes two attacks with its claws.

**Claws.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*  2d8+2 slashing damage.

**Change Shape.** The nekomata can use its action to polymorph into a humanoid, a house cat, or its true form, which is a medium, two-tailed, bipedal cat. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

**Charm.** The nekomata targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the nekomata, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the nekomata. The charmed target regards the nekomata as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn’t under the nekomata’s control, it takes the nekomata’s requests or actions in the most favorable way it can.

Each time the nekomata or the nekomata’s companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the nekomata is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The nekomata’s innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 13, +3 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

- At will: *produce flame*
- 1/day: *animate dead*, *enthrall*, *hellish rebuke*

## Description

The nekomata, or forked cat, is a two-tailed variety of bakeneko. While they are born in the same way as other bakeneko, only the oldest and meanest become nekomata. When one of these domestic cats becomes a yōkai, its tail splits down the center, creating two identical tails. Then, like bakeneko, they begin walking on two legs, grow to the size of adult humans, and begin speaking.

Unlike bakeneko, who enjoy causing mischief but are not inherently malicious, nekomata view humans and their ilk with contempt. They use their control of fire to kill those they dislike, animate corpses to use as servants, and use their enchantment magic to blackmail or enslave hapless humans.
