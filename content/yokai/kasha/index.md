## Traits

**Avoidance.** If the kasha is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

**Keen Hearing and Smell.** The kasha has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

**Otherworldly Perception.** The kasha can sense the presence of any creature within 30 feet of it that is invisible or on the Ethereal Plane. It can pinpoint such a creature that is moving.

## Actions

**Multiattack.** The kasha makes two attacks with its claws.

**Claws.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*  2d10+4 slashing damage.

**Fire Breath (Recharge 5–6).** The kasha exhales fire in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Change Shape.** The kasha can use its action to polymorph into a humanoid, a house cat, or its true form, which is a large human-cat hybrid. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The kasha’s innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 15, +4 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

- At will: *produce flame*, *shocking grasp*
- 3/day: *animate dead*, *hellish rebuke*

## Description

As cats age, they develop supernatural powers and turn into yōkai. Some turn into bakeneko, more powerful and malevolent cats turn into nekomata, and the oldest of those who have learned to hate humans turn into kasha. While their name means “fire cart,” kasha have nothing to do with flaming transportation. Instead they are large bipedal felines who are surrounded by hellish flames and crackling electricity.

Kasha feed on fresh human corpses, and are most frequently encountered at funeral services, where they have been waiting, disguised as a typical house cat. When the body is unattended for a moment, the kasha transforms and snatches the corpse.

In order to prevent kasha from absconding with the bodies of the recently deceased, shinkan perform elaborate rituals, hold decoy funeral ceremonies, and prepare their shrines with ōfuda to ward against them.
