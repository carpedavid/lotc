半妖

Hanyō are the children of mortals (typically humans) and yōkai. Most yōkai are feared by mortals, as they have a reputation for disguising themselves as alluring humans, and using their charm to seduce and consume their victims.

However, legends are filled with stories of yōkai falling in love with an intended victim, marrying, and then bearing children. Often, these marriages end unhappily when the yōkai’s true nature is discovered, with the yōkai leaving the family and returning to the spirit world. Every rule has exceptions, though; sometimes, the yōkai will raise the child, and, more rarely, the parents will remain together.

Regardless of a hanyō’s upbringing, their dual nature often drives conflict within themselves, their families, and communities.

## Physical Description

Hanyō closely resemble humans, though their features tend to be fantastic and exaggerated, and they often have inhuman hair, skin, or eye colors. Depending on their ancestry, some hanyō sport horns or fangs, and they may stand up to a foot taller than their human counterparts and weigh up to fifty pounds more.

## Personality

Hanyō possess the same types of personality traits that normal humans do, but they tend toward extreme versions of them. The conflicting nature of their heritage often drives them toward chaotic behavior.

## Society

Hanyō have no society of their own and must learn to survive in whatever society they are born into.

## Adventurers and Relations

The chaotic personality of hanyō is often accompanied by an intense wanderlust. Some adventure to satisfy this drive, some adventure because they feel unwelcome in the society of their birth and some adventure to find their parents (often to take revenge).

Hanyō are looked upon with suspicion and fear by others. They must overcome initial hostile attitudes wherever they travel, though kitsune are normally the most accommodating towards them. They are typically shunned by the barbaric urokobito.
