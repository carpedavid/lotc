Most ninja guilds are headed by a single jōnin, or high ninja. Acting as the jōnin's lieutenants are several chūnin, or middle ninja. Reporting to the chūnin are the majority of guild members, known as genin, or low ninja.

The rules by which ninja guilds operate are called ninpō. While each guild has its own rules and codes, all ninpō share a prohibition against revealing the secrets of the guild or of the daimyō that employs them.

Ninja very rarely leave their guilds. Even those that retire or take up the life of a monk are still considered to be a valuable part of the ninja family. In rare cases, and only with the permission of her jōnin, a ninja may sever all ties with her guild to pursue another life.

Those that leave a guild without permission are referred to as nukenin, or fugitive ninja, and are hunted down and killed.
