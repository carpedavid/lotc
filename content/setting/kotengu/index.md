小天狗

こてんぐ

Kotengu are a race of migratory crow-people native to the deep mountains of Tsurukoku. They are clever problem-solvers who delight in word games and linguistic pursuits.

## Physical Description

At first glance, kotengu appear to be giant crows that stand slightly over three feet tall, and weigh forty to forty-five pounds. Their plumage is glossy black and may have a green or purple sheen.

Unlike their corvid cousins, kotengu have forward-facing eyes and elongated legs, which let them walk like normal bipeds. Their wings end in clawed hands featuring three fingers and an opposable thumb.

## Personality

Kotengu are gregarious nomads who value freedom of movement, have a communal view of private property, and possess a fondness for temporary tools. As flying creatures, they travel light and prefer to live off the land, avoiding the establishment of permanent settlements.

## Society

Kotengu form family groups of up to 15 individuals, known as flocks, who travel and roost together. They frequently band together with other flocks to defend themselves against threats or to gather food and supplies.

## Adventurers and Relations

The kotengu’s vagabond tendencies often lead to a life of exploration, and they are comfortable partnering with groups of adventurers for weeks, months, or years before flying off to explore new vistas.

As flying creatures with no beasts of burden, kotengu place little value on material goods. They take what they need and give what they don’t. Instead, they cherish the memories of their experiences. Adventuring companions of years past often star in intricate tales told with warmth and admiration.

The most frequent source of conflict for kotengu is when they encounter more settled species, who often hold very strong views on private property. Kotengu think nothing of stripping a farmer’s field of crops or absconding with a few sheep. After all, the farmer wasn’t using them, right?

As a result, they are often viewed as a nuisance by human and kitsune communities.
