Feats are an optional rule. The GM decides whether they’re used and may also decide that some feats are available in a campaign and others aren’t.  An ascended species feat represents either a deepening connection to your species’ culture or a physical transformation that brings you closer to an aspect of your species’ lineage.

## Bakemono

*Prerequisite: Kitsune*

As an action, you can assume the form of a [small fox](/yokai/kitsune-fox). You can stay in this form indefinitely, and you can revert to your normal form by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

- Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the fox, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the fox. If the fox has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the fox’s bonus instead of yours.
- When you transform, you assume the fox’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in fox form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.
- You can cast spells using your tail for any somatic components, but your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your fox form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as *call lightning*, that you’ve already cast.
- You retain the benefit of any features from your class or other source and can use them if the fox form is physically capable of doing so.
- You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the fox form to wear a piece of equipment, based on your shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.

## Nopperabō

*Prerequisites: Kitsune, Bakemono feat*

Your control over your shape changing ability has improved, and you can now assume a terrifying appearance.

- You learn the *disguise self* spell and can cast it a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, regaining any expended uses when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this ability.
- While in your humanoid form, you can use an action to temporarily take the appearance of a *nopperabō*, a humanoid with no facial features. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier), and a target automatically succeeds if it can’t see you. On a failed save, a target becomes frightened of you for 1 minute, or until you use a bonus action to dispel your nopperabō appearance. If the frightened target takes any damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once you have used this ability, you are unable to use it again until you have finished a short or long rest.

## Shifty!

*Prerequisite: Urokobito*

You’ve mastered the art of running away while still getting in one last shot. You gain the following benefits:

- Increase your walking speed by 5 feet.
- You have advantage on any Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check you make to escape from being grappled.
- When you use your action to Disengage, you can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack.
