Mon are Tsurukokan family crests. They generally consist of a circular motif surrounding a symbolic design of some sort, such as bamboo, cherry blossoms, or a sake jug. For example, the Mikado’s mon is a flying crane surrounded by a solid circle.

Mon are often worn on kimono, appearing on the sleeves, back, or chest – and the larger the mon, the more formal the kimono is considered. Mon are also found on a samurai’s *kabuto*, or helmet, and *sashimono*, or personal banner.
