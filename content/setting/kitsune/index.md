きつね

Kitsune are a species of mischievous, humanoid foxes. They are the second most populous humanoid species in Tsurukoku, and live alongside humans in both rural and urban areas.

## Physical Appearance

Kitsune resemble a human/fox hybrid, with vulpine facial features, including a pointed, slightly upturned muzzle, and erect ears. Depending on their ethnicity, their fur ranges from reddish-brown to a dull tan, to white, silver, black, or dark grey. Their eyes are a deep amber color and have vertically slit pupils, like a cat.

Kitsune are, on average, about as tall as humans, but are more slightly built. Like humans, males usually have greater muscle mass and stand a few inches taller than females.

Kitsune have an extremely long lifespan, upwards of nine hundred years. Every century, a kitsune will grow another tail, and the most venerable members of the species can end up with nine.

## Personality and Behavior

Kitsune are capricious and curious creatures. While they are not generally malicious, they do enjoy playing pranks and derive a deep sense of satisfaction from watching others get their just desserts. Kitsune almost always have some scheme in motion and treat others as though they do, as well.

As ascended canids, kitsune exhibit certain canine behaviors that other ascended species sometimes find unusual.

Within the kitsune community, there is significant debate on grooming. Kitsune from Tsurukoku have largely adopted the human practice of washing their coat with soap and water. Kitsune from the Hordelands, on the other hand, still exclusively practice oral grooming habits.

Even kitsune that have adopted a human style of grooming, though, will engage in mutual oral grooming with family and close friends. Parent kitsune commonly groom their young children this way, even when they, themselves, do not.

Unlike other humanoid canids, kitsune are not pack-oriented. Foxes are primarily solitary hunters who rely on stealth, and kitsune share this trait. While they can be perfectly social, their need for frequent isolation can sometimes be interpreted as arrogance or aloofness.

## Society

Despite their tendency toward mischief, kitsune have managed to fully integrate themselves into human society. As a result, there are few isolated kitsune communities, and even the smallest mountain village will have at least one kitsune family.

Conversely, there are few homogeneous kitsune communities. Even in areas where kitsune are the dominant humanoid species, one will find humans living among them.

## Adventurers and Relations

Kitsune have an insatiable appetite for new information and experiences, so much so that they will often work to generate new experiences when life does not provide them. Therefore, many kitsune take up the mantle of the adventurer in order to satiate this appetite, while others are forced into the life of adventure when they make things a little too interesting at home.

Because of their tendency to treat anyone they meet with suspicion, kitsune often take a very long time to build trusting relationships. Consequently, the bonds they form tend to be unbreakable once established.

## Ethnicity

**Khümüüs.** Hordelander kitsune call themselves *üneg*. They have grey to yellowish fur and pale markings around their face. Their coat becomes longer and silkier in the winter and turns straw-grey in color.

**Naari.** Kitsune are known as *al thaelab* in al Naar, the Land of Fire. They have adapted to life in the harsh desert environment, and have larger ears and a more slender build than their Tsurukokan cousins.

**Rajput.** *Lomri* is the Rajput name for kitsune. Their fur ranges from brown to grey to reddish-brown, and they have a more slight build than those from Tsurukoku. Lomri have prominent black markings on the tips of their tails.
