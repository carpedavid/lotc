## Tsurukokan Names

Noble Tsurukokan names are composed of a family name followed by a given name, with no middle name. Commoners are not permitted to use family names. When the need to distinguish between people of the same name arises, commoners add a descriptive word or two to their names. For example, a merchant might employ his brand, a farmer might call himself the son of someone, and an artisan might employ the town of his birth.

### Family Names

The majority of family names are composed of one, two, or three kanji, and derive from features of the local landscape. For example, Ishikawa (石川) means “river of the stones,” while Yamamoto (山本) means “the base of the mountain.”

Common family names include: Itō, Kobayashi, Nakamura, Saitō, Suzuki, Takahashi, Tanaka, Watanabe, Yamamoto

### Male Names

Male names often end in *-rō* meaning “son” (e.g. Ichirō), *-ta* meaning “great” (e.g. Kenta), or *-o* meaning “man” (e.g. Akio).

Common male names include: Akio, Daichi, Daisuke, Ichirō, Jun, Kazuki, Kenta, Naoto, Ren, Riku, Shō, Takahiro, Tatsuya, Yū.

### Female Names

Female names frequently end in *–ko* meaning “child” (e.g. Keiko), *–mi* meaning “beauty” (e.g. Yumi), or *-ka* meaning “perfume” or “flower” (e.g. Reika).

Common female names include: Ai, Chinatsu, Fumiko, Hina, Kana, Keiko, Miho, Mizuki, Nanami, Reika, Riko, Sakura, Yumi, Yuna

### Honorifics

When Tsurukokans address each other, they almost always do so by employing one of the titles described below. Using no title indicates a level of extreme familiarity usually limited to siblings, spouses, or a parent addressing a child. When used, the title is added as a suffix to the subject’s surname. For example, when talking to the samurai Kurosawa Musashi, a peasant would address him as “Kurosawa-sama.” When addressing peasants, or those that do not have a surname, the title is added to the subject’s given name. For example, if talking to Takeshi, one might address him as “Takeshi-san.”

- Dono — used when addressing one’s own daimyō. It is an elevated form of sama.
- Sama — used when addressing one’s superiors, or when showing great respect for someone. It is the rough equivalent of “Lord or Lady.” A commoner addressing a noble would use this title.
- Sensei — used when addressing a teacher of any sort, or a “master” of an art form or trade.
- San — this is the default honorific, used when addressing an equal or near equal. It is the equivalent of calling someone “Mr. or Ms.”
- Kun — used to address a male friend or subordinate.
- Chan — used to address a female friend or close companion.

## Hordeland Names

Children hailing from the Hordelands are typically named by a khan or other respected elder. They are given names that combine two auspicious words (like eternity, flower, happiness, iron, or strength). For example, the male name Batbayar means “unyielding happiness,” while the female name Enkhtuya means “ray of peace.”

While Hordelanders organize themselves into clans, they do not use clan names as family names. Instead, they use a patronymic or matronymic, depending on who runs the family. The patronymic or matronymic is always placed first when a Hordelander uses their full name.

Hordelanders that have assimilated into Tsurukokan society may adopt Tsurukokan family and given names.
