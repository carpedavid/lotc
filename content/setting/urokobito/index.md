鱗人

In Tsurukoku, kobolds are known as *urokobito*, or “scaly people,” and are considered outsiders. They hail from the Hordelands to the south of the Nagara River.

## Physical Appearance

Urokobito are small creatures that stand about two and a half to three feet tall. They have scaly skin, like reptiles, a short, non-prehensile tail, and yellow eyes. Most are slightly built, though it is considered a status symbol among urokobito to be somewhat rotund. Urokobito display no gender disparity in terms of size or muscle mass.

An urokobito’s scales vary in color and pattern, from dull green to deep blue and black to bright red and yellow. Members of a clan tend to have similar coloration and patterns.

## Personality

Urokobito are skittish, nervous, and generally high-strung. They are shrill and demanding, and have little patience for genteel society.

## Society

Urokobito understand that their strength is numbers. They reproduce wildly, as they know that their lives are short, and having lots of children is the best way to continue their legacy.

In the Hordelands, urokobito organize themselves into nomadic, lizard-riding clans, called *hordes*. Their leadership structure is based primarily on military prowess, and the most skilled warrior is elected *khan* by the nobles of his or her clan.

In Tsurukoku, urokobito tend to congregate together in slums and other socioeconomically depressed areas. They are often the target of hostility from humans and kitsune society, which views them as barbaric outsiders. As a result, urokobito society is tightly knit, and they will go out of their way to support others of their race.

## Adventurers and Relations

Urokobito take up the life of an adventurer for many reasons. Some have been ostracized from their clan, some seek to gain power of their own, some adventure to bring glory to their own clan or to strengthen themselves for a possible return to the Hordelands.

Few people inside of Tsurukoku like urokobito. Their nervous demeanor makes many people uncomfortable, and their utter disregard for the customs of Tsurukokan society makes them a social liability.
