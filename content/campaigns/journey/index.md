D&D 3E, complete

Many years ago, my gaming group embarked on a campaign in a world inspired by manga, anime, and a healthy dose of kung-fu films. That campaign world eventually became the Land of the Crane, and was published for the True20 game system by [Green Ronin](https://greenronin.com) publishing. I recorded the adventures of our gaming group as their characters journeyed from their homeland in the south to the mountains of the north in order to deliver offerings to the great spirit known as the Fire Crane.

You can download a PDF of the compiled adventures of clan Kurosawa, which currently takes the reader through their first major campaign arc:
